## Installation & Usage as a [ROS 2] package

### Dependencies
This package depends on the linear algebra library [Eigen], which can be installed by

    sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev

The [ROS 2] dependencies are listed in the package.xml and can be installed by

    rosdep install steering_functions


### Building

To build this package from source, clone it into your workspace and compile it in *Release* mode with the following commands. This will also build all tests.

    cd ros2_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/hbanzhaf/steering_functions.git
    cd ..
    colcon build --packages-up-to steering_functions --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Note that the demo node is not yet ported to [ROS 2], only the library functions are available.


### Linking

To link this library with another [ROS 2] package, add these lines to your package's CMakeLists.txt

    find_package(steering_functions REQUIRED)

    target_link_libraries(your_target steering_functions::steering_functions)

and the following lines to your package's package.xml

## Documentation
### Conventions
In this implementation, a path is described by *N* segments. Each segment is given by the open-loop control inputs **u**<sub>*k*</sub> = *[delta_s<sub>k</sub>, kappa<sub>k</sub>, sigma<sub>k</sub>]<sup>T</sup>*, where *k = 1...N* iterates over the *N* segments, *delta_s<sub>k</sub>* describes the signed arc length of segment *k*, *kappa<sub>k</sub>* the curvature at the beginning of segment *k*, and *sigma<sub>k</sub>* the linear change in curvature along segment *k*.

The states of the robot can be obtained with a user-specified discretization by forward integrating the open-loop controls **u**<sub>*k*</sub>. A robot state consists of **x** = *[x, y, theta, kappa, d]<sup>T</sup>*, where *x, y* describe the center of the rear axle, *theta* the orientation of the robot, *kappa* the curvature at position *x, y*, and *d* the driving direction ({-1,0,1}).

In addition to that, this package is capable of computing a Gaussian belief along the nominal path given an initial belief, the motion and measurement noise, and a feedback controller. A belief *bel*(**x**) is described by the mean *mu*, the covariance of the state estimate *Sigma*, the distribution over state estimates *Lambda*, and the total covariance *Sigma + Lambda*. Further details can be found in [1].


### Start and Goal State
All steering functions expect a start state **x**<sub>*s*</sub> = *[x<sub>s</sub>, y<sub>s</sub>, theta<sub>s</sub>, kappa<sub>s</sub>, d<sub>s</sub>]<sup>T</sup>* and a goal state **x**<sub>*g*</sub> = *[x<sub>g</sub>, y<sub>g</sub>, theta<sub>g</sub>, kappa<sub>g</sub>, d<sub>g</sub>]<sup>T</sup>* as input. Note that the initial and final driving direction are selected by the steering function according to the computed path. They can not be selected manually, therefore, leave *d<sub>s</sub>* = *d<sub>g</sub>* = 0.

Depending on the two superscripts in the name of the steering function (see Section *Computation Times* for an overview), a different curvature is applied to the start (first superscript) and goal state (second superscript). The superscript 0 denotes that zero curvature is enfored no matter which curvature is given at that state. The superscript Â± indicates that either positive or negative max. curvature is selected by the steering function if the user inputs no curvature. However, if a non-zero curvature is assigned, the steering function computes that path with the corresponding signed max. curvature. This feature can be useful in sampling-based motion planners when cuvature continuity has to be ensured at the connection of two extensions.

Additionally, the steering functions CC-Dubins and HC-Reeds-Shepp compute a path that takes into account an arbitrary start and goal curvature specified by the user.


### Statistics
A benchmark of the G<sup>2</sup> continuous steering functions against their G<sup>1</sup> continuous counterpart is illustrated in the following histograms (10<sup>5</sup> random steering procedures, max. curvature = 1 m<sup>-1</sup>, max. sharpness = 1 m<sup>-2</sup>.). The first row shows a comparison of the path length, and the second row compares the number of curvature discontinuities in the computed path:

### Interfacing with OMPL
In order to use the continuous and hybrid curvature state spaces along with [OMPL], a new OMPL state space has to be created as described [here](http://ompl.kavrakilab.org/2012/03/18/geometric-planning-for-car-like-vehicles.html). OMPL requires a distance and an interpolate function, which are provided in this package.
